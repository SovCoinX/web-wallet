            You can safely import any external Sovereign address. This action will not adversely affect imported addresses in any way, such as
            making them unavailable for other wallets. It will only include them for use from this wallet. Note though, that imported addresses
            are not recoverable using the pass phrase of this wallet. You are responsible for managing their private keys individually.
            <br/><br/>

            There are two options available for importing external addresseses. The first is as a <strong>watch-only</strong> address, where you
            do not have to supply any private keys. A necessary limitation is that you will not be able to spend/send from such an address.
            You will only be able to see the balance. The other option is to supply the private key for an address, which will allow you to
            spend/send from it. Remember, private keys are kept only in this wallet, they are <strong>NOT</strong> sent or stored anywhere,
            at any time. From that perspective, you are not entrusting your keys to anyone, including us.
